# openQDA
Web-based software to do qualitative analysis of images.

This software was created to help me organize and analyse the data I collected for my Ph.D. research project.
The software works based on four concepts: sources, codes, sections and attributes.

Sources: they are the files which actualy contain the data to be organized and analysed. At this moment, OpenQDA only supports images, but I intend to expand it to text, videos and audios.

Attributes: you can apply attributes to sources as a way to organize, describe or even analyse them. For instance, you may create the attribute DATE and then use ti to record the date in which a source was created.

Sections: they are parts (or fragments) of a source. In the case of an image, it is a rectangular section of it. For a text, a section would be a string. For a video or audio, it would be an interval.

Codes: they are like tags that can be applied to sections (not sources). This is sort of the universal tool for qualitative analysis. Tipically, the researcher identifies a part of a source (for instance, a sentence from an interview) and associates that part with a code that refers to a phenomena of interest.

In certain sense, this software is the first step towards an open alternative for NVivo.

At this moment, the sofwtare lacks lots of basic features, such as the possibility of removing or editing images, attributes, codes and sections. If you are looking for something ready to use, DO NOT use this software. I just shared as a way to find more people interested in a long term partnership to develop it.
